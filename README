Description:
A Ruby (partial) implementation of the Upcoming.org API.  Responses
return ruby objects where the each attribute becomes a class variable
with appropriate get/set methods.

Security:
Although the values of XML attributes are slash-escaped to prevent 
misinterpretation of incidental or malicous quote characters, this library
does assume that XmlSimple will properly handle malformed or malicious 
XML.

Usage:

require 'upcoming'
Upcoming::Event.apikey = "<your API key>"
e = Upcoming::Event.find_by_event_id <event id>

Dependencies:
XmlSimplea (Currently assumed to come via RubyGems)
Net::Http

Caveats:
Because Rails comes with a slightly different version of XmlSimple, the
require 'xmlsimple' statement may need to be removed to work in a Rails
project.

Todo:
* Add test suite
* Implement full Event.search functionality
* Create gem
* Implement all public functions for Event, Metro, State, Country, 
  Venue, and Category
* Implement Auth functionality
* Complete remaining API
